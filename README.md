# Project 10: Diary App

Grade Attempted: Exceeds Expectations

For this project, you will create a Core Data-based Diary App in Swift. You will be responsible for creating the data layer, the UI, as well as all other aspects. You are free to follow the provided mockups or design your own UI, provided the user experience is clear. Given the relatively small feature set for this app, give special attention in creating a good object model and writing clean, extensible code. Be sure to include unit tests, error handling and selecting just the right Swift language “tools” for the job. It might mean a lot of refactoring and getting peer reviews prior to submission. We hope you take the time to create a nice app!

At a minimum, your app should include the following features:

A basic master-detail view architecture
Ability to create text journal entries and display a timestamp for each entry
Ability to edit and delete existing journal entries
Ability to add geolocation data to an entry
Comprehensive unit testing coverage for your code

Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.

 6 steps
Please leverage the Slack community to ask questions or bounce idea about the project.

Create the Core Data driven Diary app using a TableView-based approach, with both Master and Detail Views.
Make sure users can scroll through the Master View to see a list of existing entries. In the Master View, the user should be able to:
Create a new entry and be presented with the Detail View for data entry
Tab on an existing entry to see the entry details in the corresponding Detail View
Edit an existing entry (again with the corresponding Detail View)
Delete an existing entry
All diary content should remain intact after a user exit and relaunch the app. All diary entries should have and display a “created-on” or “last updated” date
Add functionality such that users can add geolocation data to an entry.
Unit Testing to cover the diary entries operations (successful creation/edits/deletion and date stamp association) should be added to the project.
Extra Credit
To get an "exceeds" rating, complete all of the steps below:

 3 steps
Add the ability to add one or more photos to a diary entry
Add the ability to search the entries via a search bar on the Master View
For the features listed as extra credit, you may employ third party libraries, if you find that helpful. Please do provide detailed comment and usage instructions for the third party libraries, such that the project can be reviewed properly.
